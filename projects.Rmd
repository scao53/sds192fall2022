# Mini-Project 1 {#MP1}

<!--

READ THIS

- Many students are having trouble loading their .ics calendar files into R b/c of filepaths. Please strongly encourage them to create a MP1 folder somewhere, put the MP1.Rmd and .ics file in the same directory, and have them load it in R NOT by using filepaths but rather using RMarkdown's default assumption that the .ics file is in the same directory. i.e. do "192.ics" %>% ical_parse_df() and not "~/Downloads/SDS192/MP1/192.ics %>% ical_parse_df()
- Some students are exporting blank calendars. If the above doesn't work, have them verify using the Google Calendar online interface that there are actually more than 0 calendar entries recorded
Windows users need to explicitly click "Extract All" when trying to unzip the MP1.zip file. Unlike macOS, double-clicking it only allows the user to view its contents; Windows users need to explicitly "extract all" to have an MP1 folder get created on their computer.
- Depending on the operating system, then calendar_data data frame might record minutes as seconds. Throw a mutate(minutes = minutes/60) %>% in there to fix that
- Tricky one: If a student recorded a calendar entry on a "repeat" schedule, only the first entry will get exported to .ics ; for purposes of this MP1 they need to create individual entries for all to export correctly (see my message in mp1 for a lengthier explanation)
- If you're still stuck, don't stress, and have the student message me. I'll take care of clean-up

Things to remember for next time:

- Add grading rubric
- When calendar entries are set to "repeat" only the first entry shows up
- Issue with time intervals being imported in seconds, minutes, hours,

## Basic outline

1. Identify a question about how you use your time *that you feel comfortable sharing with your partner and me*.
1. Start the data collection process: start logging time in Google Calendar, macOS Calendar, or Outlook.
1. Export the calendar to `.ics` file format and then import into R.
    + The screencast created by Prof. Albert Y. Kim demonstrates how to do this with Google Calendar. 
    + Test this early and test this often!
1. Exchange data! You will pass your question and data to your partner, and they will do an analysis with two non-redundant data visualizations.
1. Write a joint reflection piece on this experience. In particular
    + As someone who provides data: What expectations do you have when you give your data?
    + As someone who analyzes other people's data: What legal and ethical responsibilities do you have?
    + The joint reflection piece should be of **no more than 500 words**.

Complete your minimally viable product! When working on any project

* Don't try to do everything completely and perfectly from the beginning. This leads to perfectionist thinking, which leads to procrastination and "analysis paralysis."
* Do start by finishing a [minimially viable product](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/02/27/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-and-why-do-companies-need-them/#178bd8a2382c){target="_blank"}. In other words:
    + [Done is better than perfect](https://lifehacker.com/done-is-better-than-perfect-5870379){target="_blank"}
    + [Don't let perfect be the enemy of good](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dont-let-the-perfect-be-t_b_158673){target="_blank"}
* Once you're done your MVP, gather feedback on how your project works. Based on this feedback, then iterate and improve.


## Submitting the project

1. Both group members: Submit the `MP1.pdf` of your analysis of your partner's question on moodle.
1. Both group members: Fill out the peer evaluation [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6w4CC9-PrWrpupNfosQUBVoCWBihRwdezYb2jJEj7-kNdfg/viewform){target="_blank"}.
1. Group leader only: Submit a PDF of your joint reflection piece on moodle.


## Grading rubric

1. **Baseline:** Projects that do not satisfy all "baseline" criteria can expect to get a grade of less than 8/10.
    + Successfully collect data and import your calendar into R. This data
        Has to involve intervals of time: a start time and end time. For example, not “I went to sleep at.” but “I slept during these times.”
        Enter in at least two types of activities in your calendar. This activity type becomes the summary categorical variable with two levels.
        You need to collect at least 10 days worth of data.
    + All code must be visible in your PDF.
    + Create two data visualizations.
    + Include at least one ethical concern in your joint reflection.
    + The final submission should be production-quality, replete with data graphics and correct spelling and grammar.
    + All accompanying write-ups are coherent and respect the word count limit.
    + You submit your peer evaluation.
1. **Minimally viable product:** Grade: 8/10.
    + Satisfy all "baseline" criteria.
    + Data graphics are customized, making use of two available geoms and/or color palettes.
1. **Due diligence:** Grade: 9/10.
    + Satisfy all "baseline" and "minimally viable product" criteria.
    + All visualizations have appropriately labeled axes, legends, titles, etc. Such information gives the data’s context.
    + All visualizations are mindful of the <a href="https://medium.com/@sudharsanasai/declutter-your-chart-with-data-ink-ratio-6f6908727842" target="_blank">data-ink ratio</a>.
1. **Point of diminishing returns:** Grade: 10/10.
    + Satisfy all "baseline", "minimally viable product", and "due diligence" criteria.
    + Written text does an exceptional job of not only addressing the calendar analysis, but also attempting to address the ethical implications of such analysis.

# Mini-Project 2 {#MP2}

<!--
Things to remember for next time:

- 24A vs 24E transaction_typ varible
- Make sure .Rproj file has save .Rdata and .Rhistory set to FALSE b/c fec16 package data is huge
- Look at current and past fec16 package issues here: https://github.com/baumer-lab/fec16/issues, especially
    + SSL errors
    + Some datasets are just too huge
-->


*Due Friday 10/28 at 9pm.*

## Basic outline

Your project will **wrangle** the open payments dataset in order to reveal **two findings** about the financial relationships between drug and device companies and certain healthcare providers in MA. You and your partner will then write up your findings in a short data-driven article of **no more than 600 words**. Your deliverable will be written in R Markdown.
Before producing your analysis, you will watch the video below, and study the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Downloads/OpenPaymentsDataDictionary.pdf" target="_blank">data documentation</a>, specifically, review the data dictionary for the open payments dataset that spans pages 22-33 to select variables for your analysis. You can explore the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Data" target="_blank">Data Overview</a> page on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service's website to learn more. You can also check out ProPublica's <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/" target="_blank">Dollars for Docs</a> platform for inspiration on how this dataset can be used in investigate journalism.

# Mini-Project 3 {#MP3}

<!--
Things to remember for next time:
- Contact Smith Spatial Lab MUCH EARLIER
- Give example of joining sf object with data frame in examples.Rmd to create choropleth map of external variable
-->

*Due Tuesday 11/29 at 9pm.* 

## Basic outline

Your project will create **one static map** using the <code>sf</code> package and **one interactive map** using the <code>leaflet</code> package. You and your partner will craft a short data-driven article of **no more than 600 words**. Your deliverable will be written in R Markdown.

You and your partner will focus on a topic of your choice in any context such as healthcare, education, climate change, sports, politics, or economics. You will then find a relevant dataset or multiple datasets. Here are a few dataset resources you might be interested in:

* US census data using the <code>tidycensus</code> package as we do in Lec 29
* <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data</a>
* <a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Census-Tract-D/cwsq-ngmh" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s health data</a>
* <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=downloads" target="_blank">Map Inequality shapefile data</a>

Here are two **randomly** chosen examples to give a **qualitative** sense of the outcome.

# Mini-Project 4 {#MP4}
*Due Wednesday 12/21 at 2pm.*

## Basic outline
Your project **must use SQL to query data from <code>scidb</code>**. You and your partner will craft a data-driven article of **roughly 300–500 words**. Your deliverable will be written in R Markdown.
The argument you make in your article must be supported by data stored on <code>scidb</code> in at least one of the six databases listed below. You will write one or more queries in SQL that will pull in data relevant to your question. Examination of that data will inform your response to the question, and you will then formulate your arguments accordingly. You may do some of your data wrangling work in R, but you should use SQL first to retrieve data as efficiently as possible. Your article must include at least one data table or data graphic.
**Databases**

1.<code>airlines</code>: on-time flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics
1.<code>citibike</code>: trip-level data from New York City’s municipal bike rental system
1.<code>fec</code>: campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission
1.<code>imdb</code>: a copy of the Internet Movie Database
1.<code>lahman</code>: historical season-level baseball statistics
1.<code>yelp</code>: restaurant reviews in the Phoenix, AZ area

## Scope
Due to the compressed time during the finals, you may limit the scope of your analysis to results that can be achieved via **a single query**. In many cases, a simple table of results will be sufficient—you should not feel obligated to create a fancy data graphic.

## Getting started

* Find your group in the <code>#sds-192-mp4</code> channel. Please identify:

    + Your group number.
    + Designate a group leader.

* Download <a href="projects/MP4/MP4.Rmd" download><code>MP4.Rmd</code></a>.
* Knit the <code>MP4.Rmd</code> file once and read it over.

## Submitting the project

1.Group leader only: Submit a <code>mp4.zip</code> file of your entire RStudio Project folder on <a href="https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=42274" target="_blank">moodle</a>.
1.All group members:

    + Fill out the peer evaluation <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegFq2mD2-twioEq3aniLRnAJQR90vJuKY1VJzN3_ZP0KGQ3g/viewform" target="_blank">Google Form</a>.
    + Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcVrUjjPEAM587UKIG_T7Nv7vsb351lcWL8SLZUw3qJ9UWAA/closedform" target="_blank">exit survey</a> Google Form.

## Grading rubric

1.**Baseline:** Projects that do not satisfy all “baseline” criteria can expect to get a grade of less than 8/10.

    + The argument you make in your article is supported by data retrieved from one of the six databases listed above.
    + Your SQL query returns the correct results you intend to.
    + Your code is clean, commented, and well-indented.
    + Explicitly state your research question motivating your analysis.
    + From the article reader’s perspective, there should be no “superfluous” and non-informative output (e.g. instructions text). You must be empathetic to your reader!
    + All accompanying write-ups are coherent and respect the word count limit.
    + You submit both your peer evaluations and your exit survey responses.

1.**Minimally viable product:** Grade: 8/10.

    + Satisfy all “baseline” criteria.
    + Write your SQL query to retrieve data as efficiently as possible.

1.**Due diligence:** Grade: 9/10.

    + Satisfy all “baseline” and “minimally viable product” criteria.
    + Your SQL query is based on at least two joined data frames.

1.**Point of diminishing returns:** Grade: 10/10.

    + Satisfy all “baseline”, “minimally viable product”, and “due diligence” criteria.
    + Written text does an exceptional job of making a logical argument supported by your data analysis and communicating your finding effectively.
