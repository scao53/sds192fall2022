```{r, include=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code block/chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 16/2, fig.height = 9/2)
```

# Learning Goals

* Join two tables.
* Practice pseudocode.


# Setup

Load necessary packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

```



# Question 1:  Honor Code

For this problem set I worked with (please indicate even if with no one): 


# Question 2: Pseudocode

Study FIGURE 3.7 in ModernDive to understand how the tables in the nycflights13 package are related.

Write down the pseudocode that is going to merge the flights and weather tables so that for each of the 336,776 flights we have merged information on the weather conditions at the time of departure even if no weather was recorded at that time.






# Question 3: Join Two Tables

Write down your code to achieve the goal in Question 2.

```{r}

```
