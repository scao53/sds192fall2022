# Reminders

* Mini-project 2 due next Wednesday. 
* Quiz 4 will be posted today and due at 5PM next Wednesday.
* Be sure to start early; there are no extensions for quizzes. 

---

# For Today

* Review of Monday's lab
* Joining datasets

---

# Load the following two data frames into RStudio. 

> What do you notice about them? Why might they be useful to consider together?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ct_school_attendance <- read.csv("https://data.ct.gov/resource/t4hx-jd4c.csv?$limit=3000") %>%
  filter(studentgroup == "All Students" & reportingdistrictname != "Connecticut") 

ct_school_learning_model <-

# Joining Datasets

* Up until this point, we have been working with data in single tables.
* Sometimes related data can be spread across multiple tables that we wish to bring together for different kinds of analysis. 


---

# Example: North American Bird Breeding Survey

.pull-left[

* Annual count of bird populations at select locations along transportation routes in North America. Data tables include: 
  * Bird counts along routes during certain observation periods
  * Information about each route 
  * Weather conditions at certain observation periods
]

.pull-right[

]

# Example: EPA Facility Registry Service

.pull-left[

* Records data about every facility regulated by different EPA programs (e.g. Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, etc). Data tables include: 
  * Location and contact information about each facility
  * Results Safe Drinking Water Act inspections, including violations and fines for the facility
]

# Keys

* To join data tables, we need a column shared across the tables that we can join on. 
* Often this is some form of a unique key. 

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
ct_school_attendance %>% select(reportingdistrictcode) %>% head()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
ct_school_learning_model %>% select(district_code) %>% head()
```
]

> What might be an issue with joining on this key?

---

# Keys 

* Keys must be formatted the same way and of the same type. 

.pull-left[
```{r}
ct_school_attendance <- ct_school_attendance %>%
  mutate(reportingdistrictcode = as.integer(reportingdistrictcode))

ct_school_attendance %>% select(reportingdistrictcode) %>% head()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ct_school_learning_model %>% select(district_code) %>% head()
```
]

---

# Join

```{r}
ct_school_attendance %>%
  inner_join(ct_school_learning_model, by = c("reportingdistrictcode" = "district_code")) %>%
  rename(fully_remote = percent_students_fully_remote) %>% #to fit on slide
  select(reportingdistrictcode, attrate_202021, fully_remote) %>%
  head()
```

---

# Different Kinds of Joins

* `inner_join()`
* `left_join()`
* `right_join()`
* `full_join()`
* `anti_join()`

---

# Inner Join

---

# Outer Joins

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=350}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c12ca9e12ed26a7c5d2aa08e36d2ac4fb593f1e/79980/diagrams/join-outer.png")
```


---

# One-to-many relationships

# Many-to-many relationships

---

# Anti-Join

* Filters to entries in the left table that are not in the right table

.pull-left[
```{r}
ct_school_attendance %>%
  anti_join(ct_school_learning_model, by = c("reportingdistrictcode" = "district_code")) %>%
  select(reportingdistrictcode)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ct_school_learning_model %>%
  anti_join(ct_school_attendance, by = c("district_code" = "reportingdistrictcode")) %>%
  select(district_code) %>%
  head()
```
]
