# Today's Learning Goals

* Be able to join two tables using R.

---

# Today's Dataset

&gt; What do you notice about the two datasets? Why might they be useful to consider together?


```r
library(tidyverse)
ct_school_attendance &lt;- read.csv("data/ct_school_attendance.csv") |>
  filter(studentgroup == "All Students" &amp; reportingdistrictname != "Connecticut") 

ct_school_learning_model &lt;-
  read.csv("data/ct_school_learning_model.csv")
```

# Joining Two Tables

* Up until this point, we have been working with data in single tables.
* Sometimes related data can be spread across multiple tables that we wish to bring together for different kinds of analysis. 


---

# Keys

* To join data tables, we need a column shared across the tables that we can join on. 
* Often this is some form of a unique key. 

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
ct_school_attendance %>% select(reportingdistrictcode) %>% head()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
ct_school_learning_model %>% select(district_code) %>% head()
```
]

> What might be an issue with joining on this key?

---

# Keys 

* Keys must be formatted the same way and of the same type. 

.pull-left[
```{r}
ct_school_attendance &lt;- ct_school_attendance |>
  mutate(reportingdistrictcode = as.integer(reportingdistrictcode))

ct_school_attendance |> select(reportingdistrictcode) |> head()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ct_school_learning_model |> select(district_code) |> head()
```
]

---

# Join

```{r}
ct_school_attendance |>
  inner_join(ct_school_learning_model, by = c("reportingdistrictcode" = "district_code")) |>
  rename(fully_remote = percent_students_fully_remote) |> #to fit on slide
  select(reportingdistrictcode, attrate_202021, fully_remote) |>
  head()
```

---

# Different Kinds of Joins

* `inner_join()`
* `left_join()`
* `right_join()`
* `full_join()`
* `anti_join()`

---

# Inner Join

# Outer Joins

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=350}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c12ca9e12ed26a7c5d2aa08e36d2ac4fb593f1e/79980/diagrams/join-outer.png")

---

# Anti-Join

* Filters to entries in one table that are not in the other table.


.pull-left[
```{r}
ct_school_attendance |>
  anti_join(ct_school_learning_model, by = c("reportingdistrictcode" = "district_code")) |>
  select(reportingdistrictcode)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ct_school_learning_model |>
  anti_join(ct_school_attendance, by = c("district_code" = "reportingdistrictcode")) |>
  select(district_code) |>
  head()
```
