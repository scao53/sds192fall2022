# Today's Learning Goals

* Understand Tufte's principles of graphical integrity.
* Create linegraphs using ggplot2.

---

# "Graphical integrity refers to how accurately visual elements represent data. Information can vary widely, even for related data, so there's a desire and tendency to scale the data disproportionately in order to make it fit in the space allowed."

&gt; Framework drawn from: Tufte, Edward R. 2001. *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. 2nd edition. Graphics Press.

# 6 Principles of Graphical Integrity

* Representations of numbers should match their true proportions.
* Labeling should be clear and detailed.
* Designs should not vary from some ulterior motive, but show only data variations.
* In time-series displays of money, deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.
* The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.
* Graphics must not quote data out of context.

* Republicans from the U.S. Congress questioned Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, regarding the misappropriation of $500 million in annual federal funding. This graph/chart was presented as a point of emphasis.
* Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah explained: “In pink, that’s the reduction in the breast exams, and the red is the increase in the abortions. That’s what’s going on in your organization.”

* Say the following piecharts represent results of an election poll at time points: A = September, B = October, and C = November. At each time point we present the proportion of the poll respondents who say they will support one of 5 candidates: 1 through 5.
* Based on these 3 piecharts, answer the following questions:
  * At time point A, is candidate 5 doing better than candidate 4?
  * Did candidate 3 do better at time point B or time point C?
  * Who gained more support between time point A and time point B, candidate 2 or candidate 4?

* <a href="https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Lie_Factor">The lie factor </a>
  * Often not very clearly defined.
  * Easy to lie by manipulating scales.
  * Why perspective?
  * Width of lines?

# Principle 5

* The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.

# Recap Principles of Graphical Integrity

* Show ***data variation***, not design variation.
* Clear, detailed, and thorough ***labeling*** and ***appropriate scales***.
* Size of the ***graphic effect*** should be ***directly proportional to the numerical quantities***.
* Be mindful of ***context*** when designing data graphics.
* ***Don't*** use pie charts and 3D charts.
