# We have had data for a long time. It is not new. However, those studies were not possible 30 years ago. Why is data science so popular today?

# Big Data
      
* "Between the dawn of civilization and 2003, we only created five exabytes of information; now we're creating that amount every two days."

# Science Paradigms

* Thousand years ago: Science was ***empirical*** describing natural phenomena.
* Last few hundred years: ***Theoretical*** branch using models and generalizations.
* Last few decades: ***Computational*** branch simulating complex phenomena.
* Today: ***Data exploration*** (eScience) using experiment and simulation.
      * Data captured by instruments or generated by simulator
      * Processed by software
      * Information/Knowledge stored in computer
      * Scientist analyzes databases/files using data management and statistics

* "The ability to take ***data*** -- to be able to ***understand*** it, to ***process*** it, to ***extract value*** from it, to ***visualize*** it, to ***communicate*** it is going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades, not only at the professional level but even at the educational level for elementary school kids, for high school kids, for college kids. Because now we really do have essentially free and ***ubiquitous data***." Hal Varian, Prof. Emeritus at UC Berkeley, Chief Economist at Google

# Coding Can Be Intimidating!

.pull-left[
      
* Coding is like learning a new language. When you are first learning it, it all feels completely unfamiliar. I will work to support you in building the vocabulary and syntax to code in R.
* Coding can be frustrating. I regularly lose hours of my day in trying to find bugs in my code. I will work to give you resources and skills to navigate coding frustrations. 
* Coding social environments have historically been exclusionary. I will work to reduce barriers to coding in whatever ways I can.
