# Data wrangling is a process for transforming a dataset from its original form into a more relevant form.

# What is that funny symbol I keep seeing in labs?

.pull-left[
* Up until now, we have been nesting arguments in functions.
* Let's say I had the vector: `class1$shirt_colors` 
* `length(unique( class1$shirt_colors))`
]

.pull-right[
* The pipe (`%>%`) is imported when we call `library(tidyverse)`
* The pipe offers a way to string arguments together consecutively. 
* Reads more like a sentence. 
* `class1$shirt_colors %>% unique() %>% length()`
]

# Six "verbs" for data wrangling

* `select()`
* `filter()`
* `arrange()`
* `summarize()`
* `group_by()`
* `mutate()`

---

# `select()`

* `select()` enables us to select variables (columns) of interest.

---

# `select()`

* `select()` enables us to select variables (columns) of interest.

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, State.Code, Number.of.Beds) %>%
  head()
```


---

# `select()`

* `select()` enables us to select variables (columns) of interest.
* `:` enables us to select consecutive variables (columns) of interest.

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, State.Code:County) %>%
  head()
```

---

# `select()`

* `select()` enables us to select variables (columns) of interest.
* `:` enables us to select consecutive variables (columns) of interest.

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, State.Code:County) %>%
  head()
```

---

# `select()`

* `select()` enables us to select variables (columns) of interest.
* `!` enables us to negate selection of certain variables (columns).
* `last_col()` serves as a reference to the last column. 

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  select(!(Hospital.Name:last_col())) %>%
  head()
```

---

# `select()`

* `select()` enables us to select variables (columns) of interest.
* `starts_with()` is a helper function that enables us to select columns by matching string patterns at the start of their names

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, starts_with("Fiscal")) %>%
  head()
```

---

# `select()`

* `select()` enables us to select variables (columns) of interest.
* `ends_with()` is a helper function that enables us to select columns by matching string patterns at the end of their names

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, ends_with("Improvements")) %>%
  head()
```

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.

![](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/img/rstudio-cheatsheet-filter.png) 

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* == checks for equivalence and != checks for inequivalence

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(City == "Springfield") %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, City, State.Code)
```

> Review the data. Why does this return 0 rows?

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* == checks for equivalence and != checks for inequivalence

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(City == "SPRINGFIELD") %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, City, State.Code)
```

> What do we need to do now?

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* == checks for equivalence and `&` returns rows that meet **both** criteria

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(City == "SPRINGFIELD" & State.Code == "Massachusetts") %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, City, State.Code)
```

> Review the data. Why does this return 0 rows?

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* == checks for equivalence and `|` returns rows that meet **either** criteria

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(Rural.Versus.Urban == "R" | CCN.Facility.Type == "CAH") %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, City, State.Code) %>%
  head()
```

> CAH refers to a "critical access hospital"

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* \>, <, >=, <= checks whether values are greater/less/equal to than other values

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(Number.of.Beds > 1500) %>%
  select(Provider.CCN, City, State.Code, Number.of.Beds)
```

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* `%in%` checks for values that match at least one value in a vector of values

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(CCN.Facility.Type %in% c("STH", "LTCH")) %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, City, State.Code) %>% 
  head()
``` 

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* `is.na()` checks for `NA` values and `!is.na()` checks for non-`NA` values

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(is.na(Number.of.Beds)) %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, City, State.Code) %>% 
  nrow()
``` 

---

# `filter()`

* `filter()` subsets observations (rows) according to a certain criteria that we provide.
* `str_detect()` checks for values with strings that match a pattern we provide

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(str_detect(Hospital.Name, "SHRINERS")) %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, City, State.Code) %>% 
  head()
``` 

---

`arrange()`

* `arrange()` sorts rows according to values in a column 
* Defaults to sorting from smallest to largest (numeric) or first character to last character (character).

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(City == "SPRINGFIELD" & State.Code == "MA") %>%
  arrange(Number.of.Beds) %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, Number.of.Beds)
```

---

`arrange()`

* `arrange()` sorts rows according to values in a column 
* `desc()` sorts from largest to smallest (numeric) or last character to first character (character).

```{r}
hospitals %>%
  filter(City == "SPRINGFIELD" & State.Code == "MA") %>%
  arrange(desc(Number.of.Beds)) %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, Number.of.Beds)
```
