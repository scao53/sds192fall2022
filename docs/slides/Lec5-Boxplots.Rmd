# For Today

* Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion
* Boxplots

class: center, middle
# A measure of central tendency is a single numeric quantity describing data by identifying a central position.

# Mean

* Sum of values divided by number of values summed
* Takes every value into consideration
* Model of entire dataset
* Heavily influenced by outliers

# Summarizing Data

* Measures of central tendency summarize swaths of information into single value
* Can be reductionist
  * Example: Measures of central tendency related to wealth in the US only tell us about those in the middle
  * Hide the experiences of the most impoverished communities. 
* Degree of spread or *dispersion* is just as important as center

---

# Range

.pull-left[
* Maximum value minus the minimum value
* Evaluates the spread of the entire dataset

# In-class Exercise

* Still use the Spotify data as we did in the previous lecture.

---

# Step 1: Load Packages

```{r}
#Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(spotifyr)
```

---
      
# Step 2: Create an Spotify Developer Account

* Copy client id and secret from your previous in-class exercise into the chunk below, and then run the code chunk.

```{r}
id <- 'COPY_ID_HERE'
secret <- 'COPY_SECRET_HERE'
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = id)
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = secret)
access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

---

# Step 3: Get Song Features for Your Favorite Artist

* Replace the text FILL FAVORITE ARTIST NAME HERE below with the name of your favorite artist and then run the code chunk. 

```{r}
artist <- get_artist_audio_features(artist = "FILL FAVORITE ARTIST NAME HERE") |>
  select(-c(album_images, artists, available_markets))
```

---
      
# Step 4: Create Grouped Boxplots Visualizing the Distribution of Values in a Song Feature of Your Choice, Grouped by Album Name

* Refer to the [`ggplot()` cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) to find the geom function you need to create this plot. 
* Be sure to add labels to your plot. 

```{r}
# Fill your code here. 
```

---
      
# Step 5: Interpret Results

* Turn to a neighbor and discuss the plots. 
   * Check for outliers.
   * Compare medians. 
   * Compare the ranges.
   * Compare the IQRs.
   * Compare the symmetry.
