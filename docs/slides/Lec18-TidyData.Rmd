# Today's Learning Goals

* Be able to pivot longer, pivot wider, and recode values using R.

# How Would You Produce This Plot?

# Observations vs. Variables vs. Values

.pull-left[

* Observations refer to individual units or cases of the data being collected.
* Variables describe something about an observation. 
* Values refer to the actual value associated with a variable for a given observation.

# What Is Tidy Data?

* Each variable must have its own column.
* Each observation must have its own row. 
* Each value must have its own cell.

# Is This Tidy?

> What variables are displayed on this plot?

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  Date = c("03/19/2022", "03/18/2022"),
  Nrthmptn_AQI = c(70, 69),
  NYC_AQI = c(72, 60),
  Bstn_AQI = c(43, 59)
)

df
```


---

# What Will It Look Like When Tidy?

```{r}
df |> pivot_longer(cols = -Date, 
                    names_to = "City", 
                    values_to = "AQI") |>
  mutate(City = str_replace(City, "_AQI", ""))
```

---

# Pivoting Longer

* We use `pivot_longer()` to pivot a datasets from wider to longer format:
* `pivot_longer()` takes the following arguments: 
  1. `cols = `: Identify a series of columns to pivot.
    * The names of those columns will become repeated rows in the pivoted data frame, and the values in those columns will be stored in a new column.
  2. `names_to = `: Identify a name for the column where the column names will be store.
  3. `values_to = `: Identify a name for the column were the values associated with those names will be stored.
  4. Various arguments to support transformations to names.

---

# Example

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  Date = c("03/19/2022", "03/18/2022"),
  Nrthmptn_AQI = c(70, 69),
  NYC_AQI = c(72, 60),
  Bstn_AQI = c(43, 59)
)

df
```

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
df |> pivot_longer(cols = -Date, 
                    names_to = "City", 
                    values_to = "AQI") |>
  mutate(City = str_replace(City, "_AQI", ""))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> pivot_longer(cols = -Date, 
                    names_to = "City", 
                    values_to = "AQI") |>
  mutate(City = str_replace(City, "_AQI", ""))
```
]

---

# Recoding Values

* `case_when()` allows us to assign new values to a cell when a certain condition is met.
* Vectorized 'if/else' statement.
* Argument format: CONDITION ~ REPLACEMENT VALUE WHEN CONDITION MET

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
df |> pivot_longer(cols = -Date, 
                    names_to = "City", 
                    values_to = "AQI") |>
  mutate(City = str_replace(City, "_AQI", "")) |>
  mutate(City = case_when(
    City == "Nrthmptn" ~ "Northampton",
    City == "NYC" ~ "New York City",
    City == "Bstn" ~ "Boston"
  )) |>
  select(Date, City)
```

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> pivot_longer(cols = -Date, 
                    names_to = "City", 
                    values_to = "AQI") |>

    City == "NYC" ~ "New York City",
    City == "Bstn" ~ "Boston"
  )) |>
  select(Date, City)
```

# Pivoting Wider

* We use `pivot_wider()` to pivot a datasets from longer to wider format:
* `pivot_wider()` takes the following arguments: 
  1. `names_from = `: Identify the column to get the new column names from.
  2. `values_from = `: Identify the column to get the cell values from.
  3. Various arguments to support transformations to names.

# Example

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> pivot_longer(cols = -Date, 
                    names_to = "City", 
                    values_to = "AQI") |>
  mutate(City = str_replace(City, "_AQI", "")) |>
  mutate(City = case_when(
    City == "Nrthmptn" ~ "Northampton",
    City == "NYC" ~ "New York City",
    City == "Bstn" ~ "Boston"
  )) |>
  select(Date, City)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
df |> pivot_wider(names_from = "Date", 
                   values_from = "AQI", 
                   names_repair = make.names)
```
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> pivot_wider(names_from = "Date", 
                   values_from = "AQI", 
                   names_repair = make.names)
```

# Renaming Columns

> Use `rename(NEW_COLUMN_NAME = EXISTING_COLUMN_NAME)` 

```{r}
df |> pivot_wider(names_from = "Date", 
                   values_from = "AQI", 
                   names_repair = make.names) |>
  rename(Mar19 = X03.19.2022,
         Mar18 = X03.18.2022)
