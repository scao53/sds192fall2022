# Today's Learning Goals

* Understand basic concepts of grammar of graphics.
* Understand basic functions of ggplot2.
* Create scatterplots using ggplot2.

# Elements of Data Graphics

* Visual cues
      * Position, length, area, etc. 
* Coordinate system
      * How are the data points organized?
* Scale
      * How does distance translate into meaning?
* Context
      * In relation to what?
* Small multiples and layers
      * How is multivariate information incorporated into a two-dimensional data graphic?

# Context

* Titles
  * A descriptive title is used to introduce the graph. 
* Labels
  * Axes and points are labeled to indicate what data is represented on the graph. 
* Legends
  * The meaning of varying colors, sizes, and shapes are represented in a legend. 
* Captions
  * Further detail about the plot is provided in explanatory text.

# Grammar of Graphics

* A statistical graphic is a mapping of ***data*** variables to ***aes***thetic attributes of ***geom***etric objects.
* Implemented in R as `ggplot2`
* `ggplot2` is included in the Tidyverse. We can load `ggplot2` by calling `library(ggplot2)`
* Load `ggplot2` in your environment. 


```r
library(ggplot2)
```

# In-class Exercise

&gt; This dataset comes from [Pioneer Valley Data](https://pioneervalleydata.org/data-download-page/) and documents estimates of population characteristics for each municipality in the Pioneer Valley. 


```r
library(tidyverse)
pioneer_valley_census_data &lt;- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SDS-192-Intro/SDS-192-public-website/main/slides/datasets/pioneer_valley_census.csv")
hampshire_census_data &lt;- pioneer_valley_census_data |> 
  filter(COUNTY == "Hampshire")
```

# Basic Formula `ggplot()` Functions

* data: the dataset containing the variables of interest.
* aes(): aesthetic mappings (mapped to variables in the dataset). For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size.
  * In a Cartesian plot, we must supply the variables that will appear on the axes (via `x = ` and `y = `)
  
---
  

```r
ggplot(data = hampshire_census_data, 
       aes(x = EDUCATT_COLLEGE, 
           y = CEN_WORKERS))
```

# Where is the Data?

* In the previous plot, we told `R` *what* variables to plot, but we didn't indicate *how* to plot them.
  * What visual marks should appear on the graph?
* geom_*(): geometric objects (the literal stuff we draw). For example, the five named graph (5NG):
  * Scatterplot: `geom_point()`
  * Linegraph: `geom_line()`
  * Histogram: `geom_histogram()`
  * Boxplot: `geom_boxplot()`
  * Barplot: `geom_bar()`, `geom_col()`
* We append this function, along with additional functions for styling the plot, using a `+` sign.

```r
ggplot(data = hampshire_census_data, 
       aes(x = EDUCATT_COLLEGE, 
           y = CEN_WORKERS)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() # Flipping the x and y coordinates here makes the labels more legible.
```

# For the Upcoming Several Sessions

* Graphical Integrity + Linegraphs
* Histograms + Barplots + Facets
* Boxplots 
* Recap 5NG + Color Theory
