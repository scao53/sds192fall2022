# Today's Learning Goals

* Understand basic concepts of grammar of graphics
* Understand basic functions of ggplot2

# Elements of Data Graphics

* Visual cues
      * Position, length, area, etc. 
* Coordinate system
      * How are the data points organized?
* Scale
      * How does distance translate into meaning?
* Context
      * In relation to what?
* Small multiples and layers
      * How is multivariate information incorporated into a two-dimensional data graphic?

# Context

* Titles
  * A descriptive title is used to introduce the graph. 
* Labels
  * Axes and points are labeled to indicate what data is represented on the graph. 
* Legends
  * The meaning of varying colors, sizes, and shapes are represented in a legend. 
* Captions
  * Further detail about the plot is provided in explanatory text.

# Grammar of Graphics

* A statistical graphic is a mapping of ***data*** variables to ***aes***thetic attributes of ***geom***etric objects.
* Implemented in R as `ggplot2`
* `ggplot2` is included in the Tidyverse. We can load `ggplot2` by calling `library(ggplot2)`
* Load `ggplot2` in your environment. 


```r
library(ggplot2)
```

# In-class Exercise

&gt; This dataset comes from [Pioneer Valley Data](https://pioneervalleydata.org/data-download-page/) and documents estimates of population characteristics for each municipality in the Pioneer Valley. 


```r
library(tidyverse)
pioneer_valley_census_data &lt;- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SDS-192-Intro/SDS-192-public-website/main/slides/datasets/pioneer_valley_census.csv")
hampshire_census_data &lt;- pioneer_valley_census_data %&gt;% 
  filter(COUNTY == "Hampshire")
```

---

# Basic Formula `ggplot()` Functions

* data: the dataset containing the variables of interest.
* aes(): aesthetic mappings (mapped to variables in the dataset). For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size.
  * In a Cartesian plot, we must supply the variables that will appear on the axes (via `x = ` and `y = `)
  
---
  

```r
ggplot(data = hampshire_census_data, 
       aes(x = COMMUNITY, 
           y = CEN_EARLYED))
```

&lt;img src="img./Lec2_ggplot_1.png" width="720" /&gt;

---

# Where is the Data?

* In the previous plot, we told `R` *what* variables to plot, but we didn't indicate *how* to plot them.
  * What visual marks should appear on the graph?
* geom_*(): geometric objects (the literal stuff we draw). For example, the five named graph (5NG):
  * Scatterplot: `geom_point()`
  * Linegraph: `geom_line()`
  * Histogram: `geom_histogram()`
  * Boxplot: `geom_boxplot()`
  * Barplot: `geom_bar()`, `geom_col()`
* We append this function, along with additional functions for styling the plot, using a `+` sign.

```r
ggplot(data = hampshire_census_data, 
       aes(x = COMMUNITY, 
           y = CEN_EARLYED)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() # Flipping the x and y coordinates here makes the labels more legible.
```

&lt;img src="img./Lec2_ggplot_2.png" width="720" /&gt;

---

# Adding Context to Plots

* What context should *always* be included on a plot?
  * Unit of Observation
  * Variables Represented
  * Filters
  * Geographic Scope
  * Temporal Scope
* We can add this context via titles and labels, using the `labs()` function. 

---
  

```r
ggplot(data = hampshire_census_data, 
       aes(x = COMMUNITY, 
           y = CEN_EARLYED)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()  + # Flipping the x and y coordinates here makes the labels more legible.
  labs(title = "Hampshire County Early Education Enrollment Rates, 2018", 
       x = "Enrollment Rate for 3-4 yr old", 
       y = "Municipality in Hampshire County, MA")
```

---

# Adjust the Scale

* scale_*(): range of values, colors, etc.

---
  
      
```r
# Adjust the Scale
ggplot(data = pioneer_valley_census_data, 
       aes(x = COUNTY,y = CEN_WORKERS)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Number of Workers Age 16+ in Pioneer Valley, MA Municipalities, 2018", x = "County", y = "Workers Age 16+")
```

&lt;img src="img./Lec2_ggplot_4.png" width="720" /&gt;

---

# Facets (Small Multiples and Layers)

* facet_wrap()

---
  
      
```r
ggplot(data = pioneer_valley_census_data, 
       aes(x = COUNTY,y = CEN_WORKERS)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~COUNTY) + # faceting
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Number of Workers Age 16+ in Pioneer Valley, MA Municipalities, 2018", x = "County", y = "Workers Age 16+")
```

# For the Upcoming Several Sessions

* Graphical Integrity + Linegraphs
* Histogram + Barplots
* Facets
* Histogram + Barplots
