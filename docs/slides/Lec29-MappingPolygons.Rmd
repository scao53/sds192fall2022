# Today's Learning Goals

* Map geographic boundaries in `leaflet`.
* Create choropleth maps.
* Recognize misleading maps.

---

# Mapping Polygons

* Not all cartographic data is encoded as a latitude and longitude!
* Some cartographic data is encoded as regularly or irregularly shaped polygons.
* Can demarcate:
  * Administrative boundaries (e.g. census tracts, zip codes, states). 
  * Feature boundaries (e.g. buildings, bodies of water).
  * Buffers (e.g. areas at a specified distance from a point source).

# Mapping Polygons in `leaflet`


```r
library(sf)
nc <- system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf") |>
  st_read()

leaflet() |>
  addTiles()|>
  addPolygons(data=st_transform(nc,4326))
```

# Choropleth Maps

* Use different shading and colors based on numerical data.
* How you set the bins corresponding to the color gradient can affect how your map looks. Let's introduce two approaches:
      * Equally sized interval bins. 
      * Quantile based bins.

# Aggregation
      
* Ecological fallacy: Assuming that a value calculated for a group is equivalent to the values for individual members of the group.

# Zonation

.pull-left[
* Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem.
* The boundaries we aggregate data into are often arbitrary (i.e. not meaningful for the analysis).
  * If I'm studying air quality effects of a facility on surrounding populations, air pollution doesn't stop at a zip code even if I aggregate my data by zip code.
* Drawing boundaries in a different way would produce different results.
