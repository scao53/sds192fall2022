# Today's Learning Goals

* Understand rows, columns, and datasets.
* Be able to select variables and filter rows using R.

---

# Vectors

.pull-left[
* A vector is a data object with several entries. 
* We define a vector by listing these entries (separated by commas) in the function `c()`, which is shorthand for *combine*.
* Let's create a vector representing the point values of this hand of cards. What is a good variable name for this vector? 
* Next let's create a vector representing the colors of this hand of cards. Good variable name?
* Let's create a vector representing the suits of this hand of cards. Good variable name?

# Uniqueness

* We can use the function `unique()` to determine the distinct values in the vector.
* Call `unique()` on the vector of playing card colors you created in the last slide. 

```{r}
playing_card_colors <- c("black", "red", "black", "red", "black")
unique(playing_card_colors)
```

> Challenge: How would we write code to computationally determine the number of unique values in a vector?

---

# Class

* Values in a vector will all be of the same class.
* We can check the class of a vector by calling `class()` and passing the name of the vector as an argument. 
* What is the class of each of these vectors?
  * `playing_card_values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
  * `playing_card_colors <- c("black", "red", "black", "red", "black")`
  * `playing_card_values <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")`

---

# Data Frames

* Every column in a data frame is a vector. The column names acts as a variable name for that vector. 
* We can turn a series of vectors into a data frame, by listing them (separated by commas) in `data.frame()`. 

```{r}
playing_card_values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
playing_card_colors <- c("black", "red", "black", "red", "black")
playing_card_suits <- c("spade", "diamond", "spade", "heart", "club")
  
# Create a new data frame for playing cards
playing_card_data <- data.frame(playing_card_values, 
                                playing_card_colors, 
                                playing_card_suits)
```

---

# Viewing Data Frames

* The data frame we just created is quite small, so we can enter `playing_card_data` into our console and see the whole thing. This often doesn't work when working with larger datasets. 
* Other ways to view data frames:
  * `View(playing_card_data)`
  * `glimpse(playing_card_data)`
  * `head(playing_card_data)`: returns first six rows of dataset.
  * `names(playing_card_data)`: returns the dataset's column names.
  * `nrow(playing_card_data)`: returns the number of rows in the dataset.
  * `ncol(playing_card_data)`: returns the number of columns in the dataset.
---

# Renaming Columns

* The column names in our new data frame are a bit redundant now since they are all in the variable `playing_card_data`.
* We can rename them by creating a new vector of column names, and then assigning that vector the names of the data frame:

```{r}
playing_card_column_names <- c("values", "colors", "suits")
names(playing_card_data) <- playing_card_column_names
```

---

# Accessing Columns

* There are many ways to reference certain columns in a data frame. 
* Today we will use the `$` to access columns (e.g. `playing_card_data$playing_card_values`).
* Call the `table()` function on the suit variable. What returns?

.pull-right[

* A collection of data points organized into a structured format.
* In this course, we will mainly work with datasets that are structured in a  two-dimensional format.
* We will refer to these as *rectangular* datasets.
  * Rectangular datasets are organized into a series of rows and columns; ideally:
    * We refer to rows as *observations*.
    * We refer to columns as *variables*.

# Observations vs. Variables vs. Values

.right-column[

* Observations refer to individual units or cases of the data being collected.
  * If I was collecting data about each student in this course, one student would be an observation.
  * If I was collecting census data and aggregating it at the county level, one county would be an observation. 
* Variables describe something about an observation. 
  * If I was collecting data about each student in this course, 'major' might be one variable.
  * If I was collecting county-level census data, 'population' might be one variable.
* Values refer to the actual value associated with a variable for a given observation. 
  * If I was collecting data about each student's major in this course, one value might be SDS.

# How do I find out more information about a dataset?

* Metadata can be referred to as "data about data".
* Metadata provides important contextual information to help us interpret a dataset.
* There are two types of metadata associated with datasets:

* Administrative metadata tells us how a dataset is managed and its *provenance*, or the history of how it came to be in its current form:
    * Who created it?
    * When was it created?
    * When was it last updated?
    * Who is permitted to use it?  
* Descriptive metadata tells us information about the contents of a dataset:
    * What does each row refer to?
    * What does each column refer to?
    * What values might appear in each cell?
      
---
      
# Where do I find metadata for a dataset?

* Oftentimes metadata is recorded in a dataset codebook or data dictionary.
* These documents provide definitions for the observations and variables in a dataset and tell you the accepted values for each variable. 
* Let's say that I have a dataset of student names, majors, and class years. A codebook or data dictionary might tell me that:
  * Each row in the dataset refers to one student.
  * The 'Class Year' variable refers to "the year the student is expected to graduate."
  * Possible values for the 'Major' variable are Economics, SDS, and Psychology.

# Intro to Data Wrangling
      
The dplyr package presents a grammar for data wrangling (H. Wickham and Francois 2020). This package is loaded when `library(tidyverse)` is run.
      
* `select()`
* `filter()`
* `summarize()`
* `group_by()`
* `mutate()`
* `arrange()`
* `join()`
