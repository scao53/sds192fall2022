## Announcements

* Note on coding style
    + Check out the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}.
    + Why is it important to write clean code, that is well documented, and actually works? To be mindful of the work you create for your [most important collaborator](https://rmhogervorst.nl/cleancode/blog/2016/05/26/content/post/2016-05-26-your-most-valuable-collaborator-future-you/){target="_blank"}.


## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. In-class exercise

* Test two useful packages below: 
    + `patchwork`: Combine two ggplots together
    + `janitor`: Clean-up messy variable names
* Work on MP4

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# 1. Combine two ggplots together using patchwork package:
library(patchwork)

plot_1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
plot_2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))

# Side-by-side:
plot_1 + plot_2

# On top of each other:
plot_1 / plot_2


# 2. Say we have a data frame with really messy names:
data_frame_ugly <- tibble(
  `asdf ?!? qwerty%` = c(1, 2),
  variable.name...NAMES = c(2,1)
)
data_frame_ugly

# You can clean them very easily using the clean_names() function from the 
# janitor package
library(janitor)
data_frame_clean <- data_frame_ugly %>% 
  clean_names()
data_frame_clean
```

# Lec 33: Mon 11/28 {#Lec33}

## Announcements

## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* `dplyr` and SQL are very similar. Both based on the same idea of [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization){target="_blank"} (1970)
* Moral of the story: If you know the `dplyr` package for data wrangling, you can learn SQL very quickly

### 2. In-class exercise

* Perform 2-3 SQL queries to convince yourself that if you know `dplyr`, you can learn SQL very quickly. This exercise is based on Prof. Baumer's lecture notes ["Intro to SQL"](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/lectures/mdsr_sql_01-intro.html#1){target="_blank"} and ["Connect to MySQL"](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/lectures/mdsr_sql_02-connect.html#1).

1. Setup
    1. Install and open [MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/){target="_blank"}; this whole process takes about 10 minutes and necessitates creating an account with Oracle.
    1. Close the "Welcome to MySQL Workbench" message
    1. Click the plus sign next to "MySQL Connections" to add a connection to a SQL database.
    1. Setup a new connection" as shown in Page 5 in <a href="https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/lectures/mdsr_sql_02-connect.html#1" target="_blank">"Connect to MySQL"</a>
    1. Click the resulting “scidb-sds192” connection and input the password in `#sds-192-general` in Slack
1. Running SQL code
    1. Copy and paste the code below into the Query window
    1. For each of the 10 code segments: highlight it and then run it by clicking the "lightning" icon.

    1. How does `ggplot2` pick default colors? Using a [color wheel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21490210/how-to-plot-a-colour-wheel-by-using-ggplot){target="_blank"}
    1. Also define colors in terms of [hex codes](https://www.color-hex.com/color/f8766d){target="_blank"}
* Mini-project 1 (MP1) will be assigned on Wednesday
    + Slack demo of how to subscribe to a <code>#channel</code>: Adding yourselves to the <code>#sds-192-mp1</code> channel. Please ask all questions about MP1 there
    + You will be assigned groups for MP1, MP2, and MP3. You can choose your groups for the final project
    + By today I will post the groups (of two) in the <code>#sds-192-mp1</code> channel. Until <code>#sds-192-mp1</code> is due, <strong>you will sit next to your partner in class</strong>
    + Please reach out to your partner with a Slack DM before Wednesday’s lecture to coordinate meeting before lecture so you can sit next to each other
* Discussion on managing group dynamics:
    + Life happens. If it does and it will affect you work, at the very least communicate and give your partner a heads up (text, Slack, etc.)
    + What to do when issues arise?
    + Don’t forget you’ll be filling out peer evaluation <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6w4CC9-PrWrpupNfosQUBVoCWBihRwdezYb2jJEj7-kNdfg/viewform" target="_blank">Google Form


### 2. In-class exercise

* Changing default `color` and `fill` color aesthetics: 
    1. Copy and paste the code below into your `classnotes.Rmd` file
    1. Change both the color of the scatterplot points and the fill of the bars. You can do this by selecting a palette from [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/){target="_blank"} or by setting them manually
    1. Run `colors()` in your console to get English names of all colors in R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(gapminder)

# 1. Recreate plot from PS02, but change default "color" palette of points:
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# 2.a) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by adding a 
# palette layer:
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# 2.b) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by manually 
# changing colors in a layer:
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange", "forestgreen", "navyblue"))

# 2.c) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by manually 
# changing colors in a layer using hex codes from: 
# https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/114219
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#dc323a", "#003f77", "#c4c1c1"))
```
