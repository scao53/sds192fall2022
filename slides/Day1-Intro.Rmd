# Exercise

* In break-out rooms, navigate to the Jamboard in the chat window.
* Navigate to the slide associated with your breakout room number. 
* Elect one person to serve as a facilitator. This person is responsible for calling on students as they raise their hands. 
* Everyone should add a sticky note with their name, their major, and the number of cups of coffee they drink per day to slide. 
* Using the sticky notes, talk through the following prompt: 
  * Find the non-STEM major in your group in which students with that major on average drink the most cups of coffee per day. Repeat for STEM majors.
* In the text box, formally write-out the steps you took to come to your answers in as much detail as possible.

# Coding can be intimidating!

* Coding is like learning a new language. When you are first learning it, it all feels completely unfamiliar. I will work to support you in building the vocabulary and syntax to code in R.
* Coding can be frustrating. I regularly lose hours of my day in trying to find bugs in my code. I will work to give you resources and skills to navigate coding frustrations. 
* Coding social environments have historically been exclusionary. I will work to reduce barriers to coding in whatever ways I can.
